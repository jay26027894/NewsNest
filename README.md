About the Project:-
NewsNest is a personal project I built to simplify the way we consume news. I wanted a platform that feels clean, fast, and focused no clutter, just real-time news updates across the topics that matter. It pulls content from multiple reliable news APIs and organizes everything into categories like World, Business, and Sports.

Why I Built It?
I wanted to explore how different APIs can be combined to create dynamic, real-world web apps. This project also gave me a chance to refine my skills in building responsive UIs and handling live content.

Tech I Used:-
Frontend: HTML + Tailwind CSS

Logic & API Integration: JavaScript

News Sources: NewsAPI, GNews, and MediaStack to fetch the latest headlines

Key Features:-
✅ Real-time news updates

✅ Clean and mobile-friendly design
